In order to be more expressive with the build, we can delegate to a script file.  In this scenario, Travis will execute a specified file
and skip the defaults.  Below is a `.travis.yml` which delegates to a .`sh` file.

.*.travis.yml*
[source, yml]
----
include::{sourceDir}/.travis.yml[]
----

<1> Indicates to Travis to skip `install` and `test` phases.
<2> Delegate to a script.

The script below conducts the needed `gradlew` commands.

.*travis-build.sh*
[source, bash]
----
include::{sourceDir}/travis-build.sh[]
----

<1> Execute `gradlew assemble` command.
<2> Execute `gradlew check` command.

Commit the change to Git push them to the remote repository.  Upon the push, go to https://travis-ci.com/ and view the build running.
