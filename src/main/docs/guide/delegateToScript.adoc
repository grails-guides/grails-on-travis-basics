In order to be more expressive with the build, we can delegate to a script file.  In this scenario, Travis will execute a specified file
and skip the defaults.  Below is a `.travis.yml` which delegates to a .`sh` file.

.*.travis.yml*
[source, yml]
----
include::{sourceDir}/.travis.yml[]
----

<1> The https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/chrome[Google Chrome addon] allows Travis CI builds to install Google Chrome at run time. To use the addon you need to be running builds on either the Trusty build environment or the OS X build environment.
<2> Skip installation step entirely.
<3> Delegate to a script.

The script below runs both unit and integration/functional tests. The Geb test is run using Chrome in headless mode.

.*travis-build.sh*
[source, bash]
----
include::{sourceDir}/travis-build.sh[]
----

<2> Execute `./gradlew -Dgeb.env=chromeHeadless check` command.

Commit the change to Git push them to the remote repository. Upon the push, go to https://travis-ci.com/ and view the build running.
