The `.travis.yml` file tells Travis what to do. It must be located at the top level of your project.  For a Grails project,
note that we have set the `language: groovy`.  Travis comes with reasonable defaults. If the project has `build.gradle` in the
repository root, Travis runs `gradlew assemble` in the `install` phase, and `gradlew check` in the `test` phase.
