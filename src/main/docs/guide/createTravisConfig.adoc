The `.travis.yml` file tells Travis what to do. It must be located at the top level of your project.  For a Grails project,
note that we have set the `language: groovy`.  Travis comes with reasonable defaults. If the project has `build.gradle` in the
repository root, Travis runs `gradlew assemble` in the `install` phase, and `gradlew check` in the `test` phase.

<1> Gives the default Ubuntu infrastructure.
<2> This line up to `before_cache` is caching configuration tells Travis CI explicitly that you want to store and use the Gradle cache and Wrapper for successive invocations of the build. Read https://guides.gradle.org/executing-gradle-builds-on-travisci/[Executing Gradle builds on travis ci].
<3> Select `groovy` as the language.
<4> Select the `Java` jdk8.

Commit the change to Git push them to the remote repository.  Upon the push, go to https://travis-ci.com/ and view the build running.
Once the build is complete, restart the build to demonstrate that Travis will use the cache for dependencies.

Gradle `check` task executes both `test` and `integrationTest` tasks which in turn execute Grails Unit and Integration/Functional Test.
However, the feature method `DefaultHomePageSpec` is ignored if we do not specify the system property `geb.env`.
