In order for Travis to execute the Grails build, the access permissions, or modes, must be changed for some files.  We will alter modes using
`chmod` within Git.

Grant permissions for `gradlew` and `travis-build.sh`:

[source, bash]
----
> chmod=+x gradlew
> chmod=+x gradlewtravis-build.sh
> git commit -m "chmod a+x gradew and travis-build.sh"
> git push
