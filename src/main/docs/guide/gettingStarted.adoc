In this guide you are going to create a Grails application on GitHub and use https://www.travis-ci.com/[Travis CI] to build
and test your code.  This guide assumes you are familiar with Git and GitHub, and that you already have a https://github.com/features#documentation[GitHub] account setup.
The guide will cover only build and test in association with Travis.  However, Travis CI has the ability to deploy, send notifications, and
highly customize CI jobs.  See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build[here] for more information.
