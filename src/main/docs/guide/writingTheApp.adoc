The `initial` project contains a Grails Application created with the `web` profile and the `geb2` feature
with the http://start.grails.org[Grails Application Forge].

The `geb2` features includes a dependency to the latest version of http://gebish.org[Geb] which is not compatible with JDK 1.7. If you need to support 1.7 use the *geb* feature
instead.

Using the `geb2` feature modifies your build.gradle as follows:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
buildscript {
...
    dependencies {
    ...
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=buildscriptwebdriverbinaries]
    }
}
...

include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=applywebdriverbinaries]

dependencies {

}

include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=webdriverBinaries]
----

<1> Apply the https://github.com/energizedwork/webdriver-binaries-gradle-plugin[Webdriver binaries Gradle Plugin]. A Gradle plugin that downloads WebDriver binaries specific to the operating system the build runs on. The plugin also as configures various parts of the build to use the downloaded binaries.
<2> Include a `testCompile` dependency to the Geb Grails plugin which has a transitive dependency to `geb-spock`.
<3> Adds the necessary selenium dependencies to use Chrome
<4> Adds the necessary selenium dependencies to use Firefox
<5> Geb is built on top of WebDriver. You need these `testCompile` dependencies.
<6> Configures the http://chromedriver.chromium.org[ChromeDriver] version to be used by the Webdriver binaries Gradle Plugin.
<7> Configures the https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases[GeckoDriver] version (e.g. Firefox) to be used by the Webdriver binaries Gradle Plugin.
